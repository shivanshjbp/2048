2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles of the same number to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with each move sliding all tiles in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a new tile with their combined value. The game ends when no more moves are possible, either by achieving the 2048 tile or running out of empty spaces on the grid.
